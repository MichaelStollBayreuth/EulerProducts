# EulerProducts

An attempt at formalizing facts on Euler products in Lean

Some results have by now made it into Mathlib.

Current projects:
* [__EulerProducts/ComplexLog.lean__](EulerProducts/ComplexLog.lean): estimates for the complex logarithm
* [__EulerProducts/SumPrimeReciprocals.lean__](EulerProducts/SumPrimeReciprocals.lean): a proof that the sum of 1/p over the primes diverges
  (now in Mathlib)
* [__EulerProducts/LSeries.lean__](EulerProducts/LSeries.lean): convergence, derivatives, products of L-series
* [__EulerProducts/Auxiliary.lean__](EulerProducts/Auxiliary.lean): auxiliary lemmas for LSeries.lean
