# EulerProducts
An attempt at formalizing facts on Euler products in Lean

Some results have by now made it into Mathlib.

Current projects:
* EulerProducts/ComplexLog.lean: estimates for the complex logarithm
* EulerProducts/SumPrimeReciprocals.lean: a proof that the sum of 1/p over the primes diverges
