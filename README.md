# EulerProducts

An attempt at formalizing facts on Euler products in Lean

Some results have by now made it into Mathlib.

Current projects:
* EulerProducts/ComplexLog.lean: estimates for the complex logarithm
* EulerProducts/SumPrimeReciprocals.lean: a proof that the sum of 1/p over the primes diverges
  (now in Mathlib)
* EulerProducts/LSeries.lean: convergence, derivatives, products of L-series
* EulerProducts/Auxiliary.lean: auxiliary lemmas for LSeries.lean
