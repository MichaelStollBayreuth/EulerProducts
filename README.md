# EulerProducts

An attempt at formalizing facts on Euler products in Lean

Some results have by now made it into Mathlib.

Current projects:
* __EulerProducts/ComplexLog.lean__: estimates for the complex logarithm
* __EulerProducts/SumPrimeReciprocals.lean__: a proof that the sum of 1/p over the primes diverges
  (now in Mathlib)
* __EulerProducts/LSeries.lean__: convergence, derivatives, products of L-series
* __EulerProducts/Auxiliary.lean__: auxiliary lemmas for LSeries.lean
