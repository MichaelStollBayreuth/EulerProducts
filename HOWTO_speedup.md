# How to speed up a Mathlib file

We explain how a slow Mathlib file can be made faster.

1. Add a line `set_option profiler true` after the `import` statements.
   This will produce lines of the form `<blah> took <number>ms` (or even `<number>s`)
   in the infoview, recording steps that took at least `100ms` (the lower bound in ms
   can be adapted via `set_option profiler.threshold <num>`).
2. For each such line, try to make the corresponding step faster following the
   instructions below.
3. Remove the profiler options again and PR!

## Dealing with specific slow steps

Here we explain how one can try to speed up various parts of the code that cause
the profiler to produce messages in the infoview.

### `typeclass inference of <name> took <a long time>`

1. Add `set_option trace.Meta.synthInstance true in` immediately before the declaration
   causing the message.
2. Look at the generated instance synthesis trace in the infoview and find the instance(s)
   of <name> that are slow.
3. Use `#synth <name> <args>` before the declaration (possibly temporarily adding `variable`s
   to the context if needed) to obtain a suitable term providing the instance.
4. Add a line
   `@[local instance] lemma/def <some name> <possibly some args> : <name> <args> := <term>`
   before the declaration (or near the beginning of the current section/namespace).
   If the instance needs some local context from within the proof, add
   `have/let <some name> <possibly some args> : <name> <args> := <term>` at a suitable
   place in the proof instead.
5. Remove the `set_option` line before the declaration.

It may be the case that `<term>` again triggers a slow instance search, so this procedure
may need to be repeated.

**Trade-off:** Littering files with local instances is not nice and goes somewhat against
the purpose of the type class system.

### `simp took <a long time>`

Replace the relevant `simp/simpa` call by `simp?/simpa?` and click on the `Try this:`
suggestion to replace it by a `simp/simpa only` call.

**Trade-off:** Proofs can get several dense lines longer.

### `elaboration took <a long time>`

Look for `_`s in the declaration that triggers it, find out what they are filled by,
and replace them by the corresponding explicit arguments.

**Trade-off:** If the explicit arguments are long, this makes the statement longer
and potentially harder to read.

### `compilation of <name> took <a long time>`

Try to add `noncomputable` before the definition.

**Trade-off:** Definition is no longer kernel-reducible, but this should not be a
problem in most cases.

### `tactic execution of <tactic> took <a long time>`

Try to replace the slow tactic by calls to simpler ones.

For example, a slow `nontriviality ... using ...` can be replaced by
```lean
  rcases subsingleton_or_nontrivial ... with H | H
  Â· -- get `Subsingleton` case out of the way
    ...
  -- now we have `Nontrivial ...`
```

A slow `convert` can be avoided by doing the rewrites that are done following it
first and then using `refine` or `exact`.

**Trade-off:** The proof may get a bit longer and more pedestrian.
